Additional information:

Note: WebMonitor RAT is extremely easy to setup. Unlike any other RAT on the market, you don't have to download or

install anything, no need to portforward any port (works anywhere you live) nor deal with complicated IP/DNS/Network settings. WebMonitor can be

used in less than 2 minutes!
WebMonitor uses a different approach, giving you maximum freedom to use it from anywhere and any device, without having to worry about hardware

locked software.

 WebMonitor is a fully native RAT, meaning it has 0 dependencies (no .NET) and will run on ALL Windows systems and

languages starting from Windows XP and up.

WebMonitor's interface is fully managed from a web page which you will get access to automatically after completed payment.
This means, you may manage your clients from a phone, tablet or PC, as long as you can open a web browser.
WebMonitor is simply the perfect parental control and employee monitoring tool!

Our mission is simply to deliver powerful, stable and fast services with dynamism, where end users may enjoy all of our services within their own

web-browser from any device.
This contributes to maximum freedom by not having to install heavy software and encounter hassle with unnecessary complex configurations.
The advantages of our concept outweighs software-based remote administration services by far.

With a rapidly increasing company and customer satisfaction rate, we are confident to satisfy anyone ranging from home-users to the most advanced

IT professionals looking for premium quality remote administration services.

You will also receive free access to our VPN servers. Privacy is our priority, so no logs are saved on our servers.
Once again, no software needed to be downloaded. Everything is done from the web browser using your PC, Phone or Tablet, meaning you can do this

anywhere, even while on 3G, 4G or WiFI anywhere you are.
